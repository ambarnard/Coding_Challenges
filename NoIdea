##From Hackerrank.com - 'No Idea!' challenge (under Python/Sets/Medium)
#There is an array of  integers. There are also  disjoint sets,  and , each containing  integers. 
#You like all the integers in set  and dislike all the integers in set . 
#Your initial happiness is 0. 
#For each  integer in the array, if i is in array-A, you add 1 to your happiness. 
#If i isin array-B, you add -1 to your happiness. 
#Otherwise, your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.

#Input the raw array
nm, arr, mA, mB = [raw_input().split() for i in range(4)]

#Change A and B to sets for faster processing (otherwise runtime error)
A = set(mA)
B = set(mB)

#Start with 0 happiness
h_points = 0

#Loop through arr and point back to sets A and B to determine points
for i in arr:
    if i in A:
        h_points += 1
    elif i in B:
        h_points -= 1
    else:
        pass

#Output final score    
print(h_points)
